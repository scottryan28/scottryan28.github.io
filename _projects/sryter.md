An experimental story-bible and novel generator built with Gradio and lightweight versioning. The SRyter helps writers prototype characters, plot beats, and worldbuilding using seeded prompts and simple export options.

Features:

- Character templates and relationship graphs
- Plot scaffold generation (acts, beats, scenes)
- Autosave and export to JSON/Markdown

A short preview: The SRyter is designed for writers who want a focused, iterative space to sketch scenes and characters, then export structured notes for revision.
