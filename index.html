  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Solution Architect. Systems Engineer. Field CTO mindset.</strong><br>
    Based in Arizona — where cloud strategy meets desert grit.
  </p>

  <p>
    I design and build systems that actually work in the wild — from resilient cloud and storage architectures to AI-driven storytelling tools.
    My background bridges <strong>full-stack development</strong>, <strong>technical presales</strong>, and <strong>enterprise modernization</strong> — helping teams move faster with cleaner, more scalable foundations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether it’s guiding a city through a cloud migration, standing up NVIDIA GPU clusters for research, or building creative tools that turn prompts into stories,
    my focus stays the same: <strong>make complex systems feel simple</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="personal-touch">
    Outside work, you’ll find me exploring Arizona’s backroads, volunteering in the community, or digging into local history over a strong coffee.
